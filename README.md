## Available Scripts -- Server side

In the server directory, you should run:

### nodemon app

If everything is all right you should see console messages: "Now listening, Connected to DB"

## Available Scripts -- Client side

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## How reminder-app works

On top you have item counter that says how many notes have been written.
In middle part your notes are displayed. This part is called NotesList.
On right of the notes are X signs on which you delete desired note.
In bottom part you have input form where you enter new note.
